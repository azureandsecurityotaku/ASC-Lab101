## Initial lab deployment
All user names and password for the environment are set to **labuser / and yours ;) **.

**1.** Login to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that has administrative permissions on an active Azure subscription.

**2.** Open a Cloud Shell window using the “>_”  on the top right hand side of the screen.

**3.** Make sure the Cloud Shell window is set to “Powershell” (not “Bash”) as shown in Figure 3.

```powershell
$script = Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalarche/ASC-Lab101/master/Asclabdeploy.ps1 -UseBasicParsing
Invoke-Expression $($script.Content)
```
The deployment takes up to 20 minutes. After the deployment has finished you will be informed in the PowerShell windows.
